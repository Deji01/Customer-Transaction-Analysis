# Customer-Transaction-Analysis
ANZ Customer Transaction Data Analysis This analysis is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions. The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZâ€™s real transaction data.
